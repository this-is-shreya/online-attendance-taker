# online-attendance-taker
This repository contains the code for the program which reads the screenshot of participants in a zoom meeting, or any other meeting, and prints the names of absentees. It can also help the teacher keep track of students bunking her /his classes, and represent that data in a bar graph(days bunked vs names of students)
